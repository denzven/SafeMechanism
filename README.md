# SafeMechanism

Welcome there! this is SafeMechanism 2.0!  
To start using the script you need to run [SafeMechanism(GUI).exe](https://github.com/denzven/SafeMechanism/blob/main/App/SafeMechanism(GUI).exe?raw=true)  
Or the [SafeMechanismInstaller.exe](https://github.com/denzven/SafeMechanism/blob/main/Installer/SafeMechanismInstaller.exe?raw=true)
Don't worry the exe file is safe to use.  

This project is Open-Source you will find the source code at my github:
https://github.com/denzven/SafeMechanism  


How to Use:  
Enter your 3-6 digit Pin.  
Enter "#" at the end to close the safe.  
To open the safe, enter your pin without the "#"  
Thats it!  

This is the algorithm of an "Temporary Safe" i had seen during my vacation.  
I was so mesmerised by its genius design that i wanted to replicate it in python! so here it is!  

This App can encrypt and decrypt txt files to denz files now!
