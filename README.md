# SafeMechanism

Welcome there! this is SafeMechanism 2.0!
To start using the script you need to run SafeMechanism(GUI).exe
Don't worry the exe file is safe to use.

This project is Open-Source you will find the source code at my github:
https://github.com/denzven/SafeMechanism

How to Use:
Enter your 3-6 digit Pin.
Enter "#" at the end to close the safe.
To open the safe, enter your pin without the "#"
Thats it!

This is the algorithm of an "Temporary Safe" i had seen during my vacation.
I was so mesmerised by its genius design that i wanted to replicate it in python! so here it is!
